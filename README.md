## Usage
**This project is currently deployed at: https://rocky-wave-37637-36d61b992c23.herokuapp.com/login**

When first visiting the page you will be prompted to login. If you already have an account simply enter your username and password. If this is your first time visiting the page you can click "Sign up" instead. This will take you to a page were you can enter a new username and password.
After logging in or signing up you will be taken to your profile page where you can view your existing characters or create a new character. Clicking on the name of an existing character will allow you to edit that character sheet. Character sheets can be saved to retain any updated information by clicking the "Save" button in the top left corner. Additionally you can generate a PDF for the current character sheet by clicking the "PDF" button. This PDF will be saved to the server and will not update with new information until clicked again at which point the old PDF will be overwritten with the new character data. If you want to download the PDF you can click the "Download PDF" button and the file will be automatically downloaded by your browser.

Below are some examples of the various pages from Dungeonkit.
